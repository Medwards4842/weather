# WeatherViaPHP
A PHP file to get data from Weather Underground API and transfer it to PWS Weather

It is pretty straight forward, edit the file to fill in the API, IDs and password information. 
Upload it to your favorite (php compatible) webhost.
Setup a Cronjob with at least 3 minutes between site hits.

In the future I'm planning on adding a database support, for those who want to implement a better 
data analysis / adjustments and backups in general.

Cheers,
Gene
